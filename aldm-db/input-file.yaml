# ===============
named_conditions:
# ===============
# Each condition consists of a choice out of a set of criteria that represent
# the presence of something. Each named condition can only consist of one
# instance of each criterion. For example, a condition can have only one
# criterion statement on the installed kernel and one criterion statement on
# the PCI IDs present, and so on. 
# The criteria within a single condition all have an AND relationship. In 
# other words, all the criteria must be satisfied for the condition to be 
# considered satisfied as a whole. For example, a condition with two criteria
# vendor_id: 1a71 and kernel: linux_lts is only true if both the criteria are 
# true.
# However, the inner values have an OR relationship. For example, a criterion
# of pci_id: [f14a,0e35] means at least one of f14a or 0e35 is present (not 
# necessarily both).
# More complicated conditional relationships can be represented as
# relationships between named conditions.

# ==========
driver_tags:
# ==========
# Hyphens or spaces specified in the tags supplied by the user 
# (either through CLI or through GUI) are replaced with underscores.
# To use multiple tags on the same collection, use a quoted string and separate
# the tags with a comma (','). 
# Tags can either be supplied as preferred tags or exclusion tags. Tags 
# supplied as preferred do not exclude drivers, but only change their priority.
# Tags supplied for exclusion eliminate certain drivers. The rationale behind 
# not fetching drivers with only certain tags is that it can have unintended
# consequences, for example certain kinds of hardware may not have dkms drivers
# at all. So providing tags as a suggestion (preferred tags) makes sense.
